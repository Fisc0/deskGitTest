        Hey guys! Those that know me probably heard that exactly how i would say
        it. Okay, as you know, I'm Fisayo, few guys call me Fisco. I'm a
        Mechanical Engineering student of the University of Lagos(this shoulda
        probably gone in the <em>Personal information</em> section, but we
        meuve). So yeah, this is not quite my 1st code, but its the most serious
        and proper one. <a href="index.html" target="_blank"> This </a> may be
        the only one that can count as a first code, but it really is an
        eye-sore. Lol (i don't know how to do the emoji thingy yet, and that
        probably is in CSS but you get the gist). To those that don't know me,
        though i'm pretty sure not many people will be seeing this, and wish to
        know what i look like,
        <a href="a picture of me.jpg" target="_blank"> here's a picture of me</a
        >. On other news, I sing. Quite wel, if i do say so myself. I probably
        shoud insert an audio, but I'm not quite sure how to, <em>yet</em>. I'll
        insert it as we go on, promise.
